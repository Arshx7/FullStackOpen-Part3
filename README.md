# FullStackOpen-Part3

In this part of the Fullstack Open course, our focus shifts towards the **backend**, where we implement functionality on the **server side** of the stack.  

We create a simple **REST API** using **Node.js** and the **Express** library. The application's data is stored in a **MongoDB** database, and at the end of this part, the application is deployed to the internet.  

The backend is deployed to [Render](https://render.com), and can be accessed at: (https://fullstackopen-part3-ysdl.onrender.com)

## Features  

- **RESTful API**:  
  Build a backend that adheres to REST principles, enabling CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for managing notes.  

- **MongoDB Integration**:  
  Store, retrieve, and manipulate data in a **MongoDB** database.  

- **Express.js**:  
  Use Express to handle routing and middleware for processing requests and responses.  

- **Deployment**:  
  Deploy the application to the internet using a cloud platform like **Render**, **Vercel**, or **Fly.io**.

## Technologies Used  

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime for server-side programming.  
- **Express.js**: A web framework for building RESTful APIs.
